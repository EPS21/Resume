Hello, I came across your company from the Stack Overflow website. I am an experienced software engineer looking for a new opportunity in Japan, have worked and led in small team settings, working in the full Software Development Life Cycle implementing initial proof-of-concepts from scratch to shipping completed projects. The tech stack I primarily used is also the same as HTM’s (C#, ASP.NET, MSSQL, Restful API, Javascript).

I admire HTM’s values of continuous improvement, following specific feedback processes, and assuring clear communication, which I believe are tantamount to a well working organization/projects as. I currently reside in the US, but am no stranger to working and living in Asia, used to live in Taiwan before starting my career in IT. I would love to pursue my next career in Japan, like many of my friends currently working, residing and enjoying their time there as well.

For these reasons I hope my skills and experience would be a great fit for this role at HTM!

よろしくお願いします
-Eric Sheng
